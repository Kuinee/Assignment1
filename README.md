This website is a logistics website for a company name "Starry Services". They aim to reach out to companies and anyone interested in their services. Since they are mainly
focused on the services they provide, there is a tab called "Servies" dedicated for the description of services that the company provides. On the home page, there is also
a portion dedicated to let the person viewing the website know what services they provide from the moment they enter the website. The colour scheme includes mainly blue, white,
green and black since these colours go well together and would better suit the genre of the company, which is logistics. In the menu bar, there is the company logo, which can
be clicked on to bring the user back to the home page of the website. The about me page mainly includes details about the company and why the user should choose them to help with
the services needed. The contact page includes the various ways to reach the company, including an address, phone numbers and an email. There is also a form included at the
bottom of the page for the user to easily contact the company without going through much trouble. When submitting the form, the website will check if all the necessary fields
are filled out, and will not let the user submit if one of the field is missing. After the user submits the form, an alert will pop up thanking the user for their submission
and that the company will get back to them within 3 to 5 business days. This gives the user a peace of mind since it is stated rough time period they will have to wait for a
response from the company.

One downside of this website is that the menu bar is not responsive, which will pose a problem for mobile users or users with smaller display screens. There is also not many
interactive parts of the website for the user to interact with, making the website a bit bland, but still serving its purpose. There is also not much to look at in the website
itself other than the information that is needed, which may make the website look bland and boring.
